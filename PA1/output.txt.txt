-O  :Output-field-names
            This option acts as a form of help for the above -o option.  It will cause top to print each of the available field names on a separate line, then quit.   Such  names  are
            subject to NLS (National Language Support) translation.
-pN1,N2,N3 ...
            Monitor  only  processes  with  specified process IDs.  This option can be given up to 20 times, or you can provide a comma delimited list with up to 20 pids.  Co-mingling
            both approaches is permitted.

            A pid value of zero will be treated as the process id of the top program itself once it is running.

            This is a command-line option only and should you wish to return to normal operation, it is not necessary to quit and restart top  --  just issue any of these  interactive
            commands: `=', `u' or `U'.

            The `p', `u' and `U' command-line options are mutually exclusive.

       -s  :Secure-mode operation
            Starts top with secure mode forced, even for root.  This mode is far better controlled through a system configuration file (see topic 6. FILES).
